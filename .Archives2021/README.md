# Python_Projects

Some Python Projects I make for fun, and to increase my knowledge of Python with.

One of my favorite Projects was the webapp where

- I learned to make a flask server usign the Raspberry Pi Guides to get the structure for submittign a practice webpage online
- I made use of the Flask Library in Python submitting HTML & CSS files to build a site.


Another favorite of Mine is the tKinterExamples where I learned the whole tKinter Python Library by myself and created some projects to reinforce that learning

- One of ym projects was a calculator similar to my Java GUI material, where I configured rows and cols to design a simple calculator to process and input user data, but with numbers.
